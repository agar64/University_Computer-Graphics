# **Computer Graphics Projects**  

## **Project 01**  
The goal of this project is to implement screen-drawing and manipulation algorithms from scratch utilizing Python, and Pygame as a screen only.

**Implemented Algorithms:**
- DDA
- Bresenham's line algorithm
- Bresenhamâ€™s circle algorithm
- Bresenham's ellipse algorithm
- Flood Fill
- Fast Flood Fill
- Algorithm for drawing a polygon
- Scanline
- Translation algorithms
- Rotation algorithms

**Showcase:**  
When run, this project plays an animation drawn with these algorithms, along with music.

## **Project 02**  
The goal of this project is to create a 3D environment on an HTML page utilizing WebGL.  
The 3D environment should have:  
- Frustum culling
- Lighting
- Rotation
- Translation
- The camera should be able to navigate it (broken)
- Animation
- Pause
- Draw gradients on polygons
- Draw images on polygons
- Do both at once (broken)

To execute it, you need a local server hosting the assets thanks to browser limitations. I personally used a program called "Servez".  
Upon executing it, it should open a neat browser page formatted with CSS and a square in the middle running the 3D environment, with control instructions under the square.
